                        <p>Who's watching?<br>
                            Tell me, who's watching?<br>
                            Who's watching me?<br>
                            I'm just an average man with an average life<br>
                            I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price<br>
                            All I want is to be left alone in my average home<br>
                            But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
                            And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
                            Tell me is it just a dream?<br>
                            When I come home at night<br>
                            I bolt the door real tight<br>
                            People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid<br>
                            But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?<br>
                            When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair<br>
                            'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there<br>
                            People say I'm crazy, just a little touched<br>
                            But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much<br>
                            That's why<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
                            And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
                            Who's playing tricks on me?<br>
                            I don't know anymore<br>
                            Are the neighbors watching me?<br>
                            (Who's watching?)<br>
                            Well, is the mailman watching me?<br>
                            (Tell me who's watching?)<br>
                            And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess<br>
                            I wonder who's watching me now (who?), the IRS?<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
                            And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)<br>
                            I always feel like somebody's watching me<br>
